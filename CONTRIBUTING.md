Capitalization / Function Naming
---
All function names should be explicitly lower-case for each character.
Use _ for spaces.

Formatting
---
Push braces to a new line. Braces are not required for control statements
with a single line "then" portion.

Whitespace Management / Line Length
---
Instead of tabs, use 4 spaces. Since spaces are universal, while tabs may be
rendered differently and allow for less whitespace manipulation overall.

For the time being, no lines of code should be longer than 80 columns.

Pushing
---
Make sure any code you push leaves the project in a compilable condition.
If you have some incomplete work, open a pull request for it so it can
be reviewed and worked on.
